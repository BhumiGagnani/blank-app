Example: Area intended for groundwater extraction
Interaction of ground- and surface water
Additional: Airport (lower left part) with possible impact on groundwater quality

Deriving a suitable conceptual model is the next step once the question / purpose of modeling is clear
Figure represents an first example of an conceptual model (illustration / qualitative functioning etc.)
See the questions marks in the figure: the conceptual model also identifies uncertainties

One criterion for model classification distinguishes the qualitative from the quantitative description of a real system.
A conceptual model provides a qualitative representation of the relevant system components, processes and impacts in the area of investigation.
This representation is often shown graphically, e.g. as block model (see below), horizontal or vertical cross sections.

Descriptive representation of groundwater system incorporating interpretation of geological & hydrological conditions

What processes are important to model?
What are the boundaries?
What parameter values are available?
What parameter values must be collected?

This abstract from Bredehoeft (2005) highlights the importance of the conceptual model
The conceptual model represents the current state of knowledge
With more data, the conceptual model can change in the future
